### Vehicle Counting with Ultralytics

This project implements real-time vehicle detection and counting using the powerful Ultralytics object detection framework. It leverages computer vision techniques to identify and track vehicles in a video stream, differentiating between entering and exiting vehicles based on their position relative to a designated line.

#### Features:

* Real-time Vehicle Detection: Utilizes Ultralytics for accurate detection of various vehicle classes (e.g., cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks) within video frames.
* Entering/Exiting Vehicle Count: Tracks the number of vehicles entering and exiting a specific area by analyzing their movement across a virtual line.
* Visualizations: Overlays bounding boxes and labels on the video frames to visualize detected vehicles and their confidence scores. Displays real-time vehicle counts for entering and exiting traffic.

#### Benefits:

* Efficient Traffic Monitoring: Offers a cost-effective solution for monitoring vehicle flow in parking lots, toll booths, or other traffic management scenarios.
* Data Collection for Analysis: Enables the collection of valuable data on vehicle types and traffic patterns, aiding in better traffic management strategies.
* Scalability: The code can be adapted to different environments by adjusting detection parameters and counting lines.

#### Potential Applications:

* Traffic flow analysis in urban environments
* Smart parking management systems
* Toll booth automation
